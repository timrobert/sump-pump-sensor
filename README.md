# Arduino-MKR1000-SumpPumpMonitor
Sump Monitor for the MKR1000

## Intro
This lab is from the Arduino MKR1000 site:
https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arduino/plant-communicator-7ea06f



## Pre-Requisites:

### Power Warning:
The microcontroller on the MKR1000 runs at 3.3V, which means that you must never apply more than 3.3V to its Digital and Analog pins. Care must be taken when connecting sensors and actuators to assure that this limit of 3.3V is never exceeded. **Connecting higher voltage signals, like the 5V commonly used with the other Arduino boards, will damage the MKR1000**.

### Setup your workstation (computer) for Arduino development

In this section we have to setup our computer to do Arduino development.  This setup will intall the programs we need to write code for the arduino and send it to the arduino to run.

The steps for this start here:
 https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MKR1000#toc2

  1. Install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE): https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
  2. add the Atmel SAMD Core - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Cores the instructions are good and have images, but the major steps and some things to watch for are called out below.
    * Tools>Boards>Board Manager
    * Scroll down and find **Arduino SAM Boards** -

      ***NOTE!*** It is important to pay attention here, there may be more than one package with this name.  You want the **This package includes** to lists **Arduino/Genuino MKR1000**.

    * Choose the most recent version from the version drop down in the **Arduino SAM Boards** section and click **Install** (at the time I did this the tutorial page says 1.6.6, and my version was 1.6.18)
  3. Install may take a few minutes, just wait.  It will say **Installed** in the boards section when it is installed, and be listed in the board manager for you to select.
  4. Select the MKR1000 in the Board Manager.
  5. Follow the Driver Installation instructions for your Operating System (Win/Mac/Linux).

  ## Let's Test it out!

  Okay, now that we have all that stuff installed, let's see if we can run a sample program.

  Plug the Arduino board into your computer using the supplied black micro USB cable.
  Then follow the steps from "Open your first sketch", stop when you reach "learn more on the Desktop IDE": https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MKR1000#toc4

  If the light blinks, then you have run your first program on the Arduino board!

## Setting up the Board

You can read about installing and working with libraries here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

The key steps are outlined below:

  1. Add WiFi to your project.
      * Sketch>Include Library>WiFi
      * File>Save

  2. Add the RTCzero Library
      * This one needs to be installed from the Library Manager first.
      * Sketch>Include Library>Manage Libraries...
      * In the 'Filter Your Search' box at the top, enter **RTCzero**
      * Click the option "RTCzero by Arduino"
      * Confirm that that it says "For .... MKR1000" in the description
      * Select the most recent version and click **Install**

  3.  Click 'Close'

  4. Sketch>Include Library>RTCzero

  5. Your sketch should now have the following code at the top:
  ```
  #include <RTCZero.h>

  #include <WiFi.h>
  #include <WiFiUdp.h>
  #include <WiFiClient.h>
  #include <WiFiServer.h>
  ```

  These lines will give us access to the code in those external libraries.
  In this way, we do not have to write our own WiFi controllers we can use one that is written and tested and we know works.

  6. File>Save

## WebServer Setup
So that we can request the data...
